# Recipe-Finder

A react application that uses data from TheMealDB api to allow users to search recipes based on the food category. For a stretch I hope to include the ability for users to add and delete recipes in their personal 'saved recipes' page. This will be achieved using local storage.

## Wireframe and UI Design
This project is still in the initial stages of development. Here are some preliminary wireframes of what the final project should look like. Wireframes were built using AdobeXd.
